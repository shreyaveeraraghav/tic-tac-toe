The Tic-Tac-Toe game is developed completely using Python.
Initially all the cells are marked with numbers from 1 to 9, in order.
The moves made by the computer are indicated by 'X' while those made by the user are indicated by 'O'.
The computer makes the first move by marking one of the cells with 'X', and then the user is prompted to enter the cell number to be marked by the letter 'O'.
Each time a move is made, the cell number to be marked is selected from the cells that have not yet been marked.
